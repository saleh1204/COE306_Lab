=== Interrupts in LPC1768

Interrupts allow for suspending the currently executing code, and
having the CPU switch to execute a routine associated with the
received interrupt request.

In LPC1768, there are 35 hardware interrupts. Each interrupt is
identified by a number called `IRQn`, or _Interrupt ID_ as called in
the LPC1768 manual. Below are some examples of hardware interrupts and
their IDs:

TIP: In CMSIS, interrupts are numbered from 0 to 34.

[NOTE]
==================================================
In addition to these 35 interrupts, there are 8 exceptions with negative
numbers. Exceptions are not discussed in this experiment.

==== Setting up Interrupts in LPC1768

There are four main steps to correctly setup any interrupt in LPC1768:

. Configure the required peripheral to generate interrupt requests. For example,
  to be able to use a timer interrupt, a timer must be activated and configured
  to generate interrupt requests.

. Enable the interrupt in the _Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC)_. See
  <<nvic>> for more information about the NVIC.

. Write an _interrupt service routine (ISR)_: the routine that needs to be
  executed when an interrupt request is received.

. Clear the interrupt request at the end of the ISR to allow future requests of
  the same interrupt.


[NOTE]
==================================================
Some peripherals that are capable of generating interrupts can also be used
without interrupts. There are valid uses for either approach. That's why it is
required to configure devices to generate interrupt requests when that behavior
is desired (step 1 in the list above).
==================================================

Upon setting up an interrupt as described above, the LPC1768 microcontroller
will be responsible for:

- Detecting the interrupt request generated by a peripheral. This request will
  be generated by the peripheral that has been enabled by software.

- Jumping to the interrupt service routine associated with that request.


[[config_interrupts]]
=== Configuring Microcontroller Interrupts

This section elaborates the four steps listed in the previous section
(<<_setting_up_interrupts_in_lpc1768>>) to configure the LPC1768 microcontroller
to handle interrupt requests generated by a given device.

The programmer must perform four main steps:

. Enable a peripheral to generate a hardware interrupt request
  (not to be discussed here because it is peripheral dependent)
. Enable the required interrupt in the NVIC
. Write an interrupt service routine (ISR)
. Clear the interrupt request at the end of the ISR


[[nvic]]
==== Enabling the Interrupt in the NVIC

The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) offers very fast
interrupt handling and provides the vector table <<keil-nvic>>.

In addition, the NVIC:

- Saves and restores automatically a set of the CPU registers (R0-R3,
  R12, PC, PSR, and LR).

- Does a quick entry to the next pending interrupt without a complete
  pop/push sequence.

- Provides many other advanced features.


.NVIC Functions

The CMSIS core module defines a set of interrupt helper functions. For
example, to enable interrupts for a given interrupt ID, you can use
the function:

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------
NVIC_EnableIRQ(IRQn);  // IRQn is the interrupt ID
--------------------------------------------------

For example, for `UART1`, `IRQn` is 6 (see <<int_ids,Example Interrupt
IDs Table>>). You can use this number or use the given name in
`lpc17xx.h`: `UART1_IRQn`.


==== The ISR

Whenever an interrupt request is generated, the CPU will jump to the
corresponding ISR. When using CMSIS, the ISR is a C function that has
the following prototype format:

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------
void __peripheral___IRQHandler();
--------------------------------------------------

.An ISR for the TIMER2 Device
==================================================
[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------
void TIMER2_IRQHandler() {
    // Your code goes here
    // Clear the interrupt request at the end of the ISR
}
--------------------------------------------------
==================================================

[NOTE]
==================================================
If you are using mbed online compiler, you need to wrap the interrupt handler by an `extern "C"` as shown below since mbed online compiler uses C++ compiler rather than C compiler.
[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------
extern "C" {
   void TIMER2_IRQHandler() {
    // Your code goes here
    // Clear the interrupt request at the end of the ISR
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

==================================================

==== Clearing the Interrupt Request

As indicated in the format of the ISR above, the last statement in any
ISR should be to clear the request that has just been served. This is
required to allow future requests of the same interrupt.

This step is peripheral-dependent and is usually done by clearing a
bit in one of the peripheral registers.


==== Other Interrupt-Related Operations

Interrupts will not function at all without the above four
steps. There are other issues, however, that are not essential in
simple applications, but can be very useful and even essential in some
applications, especially when you have multiple interrupts. We will
discuss two such issues here:

. Interrupt status
. Interrupt priority


===== Interrupt Status

Sometimes, you need to check the status of a specific interrupt. For example, is
it pending, active or disabled.

When using CMSIS, the status of interrupts can be checked by calling one of the
following functions, depending on the application:

- `uint32_t NVIC_GetPendingIRQ(IRQn_Type IRQn)`

* If the interrupt status is _not pending_, the function returns `0`.
* If the interrupt status is _pending_, the function returns `1`.

- `uint32_t NVIC_GetActive(IRQn_Type IRQn)`

* If the interrupt status is _not active_, the function returns `0`.
* If the interrupt status is _active_, the function returns `1`.


===== Interrupt Priority

When using CMSIS, you can set interrupt priorities by calling the
function:

`void NVIC_SetPriority(IRQn_Type IRQn, uint32_t priority)`

- The fist argument is the interrupt ID.

- The second argument represents the priority, where 0 is the highest
  priority and 31 is the lowest priority.


[TIP]
==================================================
To assign a different priority for each interrupt, you need to call
this function for every interrupt you are using.
==================================================


=== External Interrupts

[NOTE]
==================================================
To practice interrupts, we will concentrate on external interrupts only in this
experiment, since other hardware interrupts require understanding the functions
with which they are associated, which we did not cover yet.
==================================================

One type of interrupts that is easy to experiment with is external
interrupts. They are the interrupts that are generated by a device outside the
microcontroller. An external interrupt should be connected to one of the I/O
port pins.

In external interrupts, an interrupt request is generated by a pulse at a pin
that has been enabled to accept external interrupt requests. A simple way to
implement that is to use a push-button to generate that request.

The difference between such implementation and what you did in Experiment 2
is that in Experiment 2, we used _polling_, where the CPU is always
busy reading the pin in order to detect a change that would trigger some
action. When using interrupts, however, the CPU is available to execute other
code. When the push-button is pressed, the CPU stops whatever it is doing and
jumps to the routine associated with that interrupt request.

There are four external interrupt channels available to the developer,
called `EINT0`, `EINT1`, `EINT2` and `EINT3`. In older ARM versions, a
pin's function must be set for the pin to act as an external
interrupt. This is done using the `PINSELx` register (see <<PINSEL>>).
However, one of the new features of the newer
Cortex family is accepting external interrupts from some GPIO pins!
Any GPIO pin used for external interrupts will be using external
interrupt channel 3 (`EINT3`).

You can use GPIO pins from ports 0 and 2 only for external
interrupts. You have about 24 different pins to choose from. Compare
that, for example, to ARM7 where only 7 pins are available for
external interrupts.

[TIP]
==================================================
External interrupts can be enabled on two sets of pins:

. Four dedicated pins (P2.10, P2.11, P2.12 and P2.13) that act as
  `EINT0`, `EINT1`, `EINT2`, and `EINT3`, respectively.

. Any GPIO pin in port 0 and port 2.
==================================================

[NOTE]
==================================================
In the two following sections, we will discuss and practice:

- GPIO external interrupts
- Non-GPIO external interrupts
==================================================


==== GPIO external interrupts

GPIO external interrupts share the same ISR for EINT3. As discussed in <<_setting_up_interrupts_in_lpc1768>>, you always need to enable
the NVIC and write an ISR.

For GPIO external interrupts, that leaves two more steps:

. Activating GPIO external interrupts
. clearing a GPIO interrupt request at the end of the ISR

===== Activating GPIO External Interrupts

To activate external interrupts on a GPIO pin, you only need to
configure whether the pin is to generate an interrupt request on the
rising edge or on the falling edge.

You can set external interrupts to be generated on the _rising edge_
on a GPIO pin by setting the `IO0IntEnR` and `IO2IntEnR` registers,
depending on the port to which the pin belongs. These names refer to
32-bit registers. Setting a bit to `1` enables rising-edge interrupts
at the corresponding pin.

To generate interrupts on the _falling edge_, you can use the
`IO0IntEnF` and `IO2IntEnF` registers instead.

In `LPC17xx.h`, the structure that deals with GPIO external interrupts
is `LPC_GPIOINT`, which includes a few fields that control the GPIO
pins when acting as an external interrupt.

.Enable Rising-Edge Interrupts on Pin 0 of Port 2 Only
==================================================
[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------
LPC_GPIOINT->IO2IntEnR = 1;
--------------------------------------------------
==================================================


=====  Clearing External GPIO Interrupt Requests

To clear the interrupts of a port pin, set the corresponding bit to
`1` in register `IO0IntClr` or `IO2IntClr`, depending on the
port. Both registers are fields of the `LPC_GPIOINT` structure.

===== Other issues related to GPIO interrupts

.Level and Edge Sensitivity (For Non-GPIO Interrupts)

You may have noted that, to enable GPIO interrupts, you have to select whether
they are triggered by the rising or falling edge of the pulse at the pin.

.Interrupt Status for GPIO External Interrupts

You can check for pending GPIO interrupts by reading the appropriate
status register. There are four status registers for ports 0 and 2
that indicate whether an interrupt is pending, and whether it is
triggered by a rising edge or a falling edge. They are `IO0IntStatR`,
`IO2IntStatR`, `IO0IntStatF`, and `IO2IntStatF`.

For Example, if bit 9 of `IO2IntStatR` is `1`, then P2.09 has a
pending rising-edge interrupt request.

This is particularly important when you have multiple interrupts sharing the
same interrupt channel (EINT3 in our case). Any one of them can result in
executing the same ISR. Now, If you want to perform different actions for each
interrupt, you need to identify the source interrupt in order to perform the
corresponding action. You can do that by checking the status registers in your
ISR.


==== Non-GPIO external interrupts

External interrupt requests can be generated using any of the 4
dedicated external interrupt pins, named `EINT1`, `EINT2`, `EINT3`,
and `EINT4`:

[horizontal]
EINT0 :: P2.10
EINT1 :: P2.11
EINT2 :: P2.12
EINT3 :: P2.13

However, These four pins are not available in LPC1768 mbed board. 




== Tasks

=== One External Interrupt

Use a push-button to generate an external interrupt using a GPIO
  pin. Do something interesting in the ISR!


=== Two External Interrupts


Use two external interrupts, where each interrupt triggers a different task. For example, each interrupt could blink an LED 10 times at a different rate.

WARNING: All tasks must be completed during the lab session.
