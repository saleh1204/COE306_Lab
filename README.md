Embedded Systems Lab Manual
===========================

This is the lab manual used in the _Embedded Systems_ course (COE 306)
of the [Computer Engineering][coe] program in
[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM)][kfupm].

Experiments are based on the
[LPC1768 mbed development board][lpc1768] from NXP, and the Eclipse-based MCUXpresso IDE. The board features the NXP LPC1768 ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller.

The manual is written using the [AsciiDoc] format. The included `Makefile` can be used to generate HTML and PDF
outputs for a given source file using the command `make`.

Pre-generated HTML and PDF outputs are available at:  
http://www.ccse.kfupm.edu.sa/~salehs/courses/212-coe306/

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.
